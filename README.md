# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 data to provide insights into the spread of the virus and vaccination progress across multiple countries. Using data from the *Our World in Data* (OWID) COVID-19 dataset, the project focuses on key metrics such as total cases, total deaths, and vaccination rates.

The analysis includes:

* **Time Series Visualizations**: Showing trends over time for selected countries.
* **Choropleth Maps**: Representing COVID-19 cases and deaths globally by country.
* **Data Insights**: Key takeaways and anomalies observed in the dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Our World in Data (OWID)**, which provides global COVID-19 statistics that include data on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and more. The data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).

## Key Features

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

* Filtering data for selected countries.
* Handling missing values using forward filling.
* Ensuring the dataset is up to date with the latest available data.

### 2. Time Series Plots

* Plotting total COVID-19 cases and deaths over time for countries like **Kenya**, **United States**, and **India**.
* Customization of axis labels, gridlines, and figure layout for better readability.

### 3. Choropleth Maps

* Displaying total COVID-19 cases and deaths globally using color-coded maps.
* Interactive map features for users to hover over countries and see detailed information.

### 4. Insights & Reporting

* Key insights from the data, such as trends in vaccination rollout and COVID-19 case distribution across countries.
* Highlighting anomalies and interesting patterns, including countries with significant changes in data.

## Requirements

### Software and Libraries

* **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
* **Jupyter Notebook** or **VSCode** (with Jupyter extension installed).
* Required libraries:

  * `pandas`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `plotly`
  * `pycountry`

You can install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly pycountry
```

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in VSCode or JupyterLab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the cells in order to execute the analysis and view the visualizations.

## Insights

1. **COVID-19 Cases and Deaths**: The data reveals that the United States has the highest total COVID-19 cases, followed by India. Kenya, with a much smaller population, has a considerably lower total case count.

2. **Vaccination Progress**: The vaccination rollout in the United States has been faster compared to India and Kenya. However, the vaccination rate in India shows a rapid upward trend in the last few months.

3. **Anomalies**: There are noticeable spikes in daily reported cases in some countries due to changes in reporting policies or data updates, especially during the early stages of the pandemic.

## Future Improvements

* Incorporate more granular data, such as daily cases and deaths.
* Add further countries and regions for a broader analysis.
* Implement predictive modeling to forecast future COVID-19 trends.
